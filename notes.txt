particle effects:
an explosion is a number of particles at random speeds and angles starting at an origin.
particles are either in one location or leave a trail of actors that disappear after a number of timesteps.
The actor itself has a different name than its motion blur/particle trail.

lay down a trail of something for a number of moves, trigger with second keypress.ø

TODO:
a function to trace an actor along a line segment
a function to trace an arc of given radius from one point to another. arc can be a small section of a larger circle.

pseudo-3d:
something that travels in an arc, appearing at a higher tile than what it would cast a shadow to from a directly overhead light.

implement box pushing, heaviness is how many turns it takes to move the object. 2x2 boxes?

add tracking of last direction of movement
on a keypress, throw object in right hand.

pick up something with left hand with 'q'
right hand with 'e' 

icons for items made on 3x3 or 4x4 grid, display in boxes to left and right of health bar
